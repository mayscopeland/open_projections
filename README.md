# Open Projections
## Completely transparent baseball forecasts for every point in a season

### Two Keys

1. Unlike most projection systems, which use stats for past _seasons_, the Open Projections look at stats for each _day_. As a result, it can generate up-to-date projections for any point in a season.
2. The Open Projections are also completely open source, in contrast to the black boxes of other projections. The methodology is available for anyone to critique and (hopefully) improve.

### Usage
_(This could use a lot of polish, but it's what I have so far.)_

Before projecting, daily stats need to be pulled from the MLB Stats API using `build_logs.py`. Run `build_gamelogs(year)` for each of the six years before the intended projection date, and then `combine_player_logs()` to consolidate everything into a single file.

Projections are generated by calling `project_all(projection_date)` in the file for the appropriate projection (e.g. `aparicio.py` or `blyleven.py`) passing a string in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".

### Want to help?
Contributions are welcome for code improvements.

Some low-hanging fruit:
- Park adjustments
- Age adjustments (by stat)

Don't code? I'd also appreciate research-backed suggestions for improving the projections in any of these areas.
